# Green Cyprus - Tree Planting Platform

This project was developed during the **HackTech Hackathon 2024** (November 23-24), where we secured **3rd place** ðŸ¥‰ in the **"IT Solutions to Improve Life in Cyprus"** category.

The **Green Cyprus** platform helps individuals and organizations offset their carbon footprints by planting trees. Users can calculate their carbon emissions, buy trees, and track their planting progress. The app is built on **Android** and was created as a minimum viable product (MVP) in **20 hours**.

This code was written with the help of **ChatGPT**, which assisted in generating parts of the code and improving the speed of development.

## Features:
- **Carbon Footprint Assessment**: Users can estimate their annual COâ‚‚ emissions by completing a simple questionnaire.
- **Compensation Recommendations**: Based on the emissions, the app recommends how many trees need to be planted to offset the footprint.
- **Tree Purchase & Planting**: Users can purchase trees directly through the app. The platform, with the help of volunteers, handles the planting process.
- **Tracking**: Each tree is mapped and linked to the userâ€™s profile. Users can view the location, date of planting, and other details of their trees.

## Before running the App:
- Set up the Google Maps API Key: To use Google Maps in the app, you need to provide a Google Maps API key. **Put your key in the `secrets.properties` file. The content should be `MAPS_API_KEY=your_key`**
